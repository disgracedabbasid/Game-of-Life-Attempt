# Game of Life Attempt

Never coded before, so tried to start simple by patching together a somewhat working demo of John Conway's Game of Life that runs for 10,000 rounds on a small grid.

## Controls
Left or right click: toggle cell state  
D: toggle 'drag mode', to drag-select multiple cells at a time; must toggle out of drag mode to kill a cell  
R: randomly bring n% cells to life (currently 10)  
Space: start simulation  
Esc: exit
